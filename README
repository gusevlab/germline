GERMLINE

http://www.gusevlab.org/software

GERMLINE is an algorithm to infer long shared segments of Identity by Descent (IBD) between pairs of individuals in a large population.
It takes as input haplotype marker data for individuals (as well as an optional known pedigree) and generates a list of all pairwise segmental sharing.
Run GERMLINE $germline -input [ped] [map] -output [out]

The program has been developed in Itsik Pe'er's Lab of Computational Genetics at Columbia University. If you use GERMLINE in a published analysis, please cite Gusev et al. 2008 Genome Res doi: 10.1101/gr.081398.108
